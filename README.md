### Remix + ChakraUI

Big thanks to [Primos](https://github.com/primos63) and [No Quatrter](https://github.com/NoQuarterTeam) for inspiration about this boilerplate.

- [Chakra UI](https://chakra-ui.com/docs)

## Instalment

From your terminal:

```sh
yarn install
```

## Development

From your terminal:

```sh
npm run dev
```

This starts your app in development mode, rebuilding assets on file changes.

## Deployment

First, build your app for production:

```sh
npm run build
```

Then run the app in production mode:

```sh
npm start
```

Now you'll need to pick a host to deploy it to.

### DIY

If you're familiar with deploying node applications, the built-in Remix app server is production-ready.

Make sure to deploy the output of `remix build`

- `build/`
- `public/build/`
